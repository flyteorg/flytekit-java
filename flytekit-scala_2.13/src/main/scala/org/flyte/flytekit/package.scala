/** Contains subclasses for [[SdkBindingData]]. We are forced to define this
  * package here because [[SdkBindingData#idl()]] is package private (we donÂ´t
  * want to expose it to users). We cannot make it protected either as it would
  * be good for the own object but both implementations deal with list or maps
  * of [[SdkBindingData]] and therefore cannot call this method because it is in
  * a different class.
  *
  * This is not ideal because we are splitting the flytekit package in two maven
  * modules. This would create problems when we decide to add java 9 style
  * modules.
