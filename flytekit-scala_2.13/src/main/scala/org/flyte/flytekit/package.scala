/** Contains subclasses for [[SdkBindingData]]. We are forced to define this
  * package here because [[SdkBindingData#idl()]] is package private (we donÂ´t
  * want to expose it to users). Making it protected doesn't help either because
  * list or map needs to call this method of elements so that requires it to be
  * public.
  *
  * This is not ideal because we are splitting the flytekit package in two maven
  * modules. This would create problems when we decide to add java 9 style
  * modules.
