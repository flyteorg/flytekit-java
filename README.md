## Build from source

It requires **Java 11 and Docker**

```

## How to run examples

You can build und run examples yourself. 

Create `.env.local` with:

```bash
FLYTE_PLATFORM_URL=flyte.local:81
FLYTE_STAGING_LOCATION=gs://yourbucket

```

Package and run:

```bash
$ mvn package
$ scripts/jflyte register workflows \
  -d=development \
  -p=flytesnacks \
